### GET /users

curl http://localhost:3000/users
Using Massive, I queried that data with the following query ""'select email, details -> \'sex\' as sex from users"

### GET /users/:id

curl http://localhost:3000/users/2
An API end point was created to query a product by id using. Using Massive, I queried that data with the following query ""'select email, details -> \'sex\' as sex from users WHERE id='  + req.params.id"
The req.params returns the parameters in the matched route. Using that I am able to retrieve the user id.
If data is returned from database, it is returned as a response otherwise, a message saying 'No user with that id' will be sent as a response.


### GET /products

curl http://localhost:3000/products
Using Massive, I queried that data with the following query 'select * from products ORDER BY price ASC;"

### GET /products/:id

Show details of the specified products

curl http://localhost:3000/products/1
Using Massive, I queried that data with the following query "'select * from products WHERE id=' + req.params.id"
The req.params returns the parameters in the matched route. Using that I am able to retrieve the product id.


### GET /purchases

curl http://localhost:3000/purchases
The API endpoint simply uses MassiveJS to perform an SQL query and return the output.
The following query was performed at this API endpoint

select price, purchase_items.state, purchase_id, name, address, email from purchase_items
join purchases on purchase_items.purchase_id = purchases.id
join users on users.id = purchases.user_id
ORDER BY price DESC

## Part 2

### GET /products[?name=string]

curl http://localhost:3000/products?name=Romantic
The API from part one was extending by checking if a query parameter with the key name was included, if it was we would perform a different SQL query where we filter for the name
I was able to access the query parameter using the query field in the request that was sent.
I used the following SQL query to get the product by name
"select * from products where title= '" + req.query.name + "'"

The query above is badly implemented and can be injected with the following query param
?name='; delete from purchase_items where product_id=12; DELETE FROM products where id=12 or title='


## part 3
-parameterised query
The /productsInjectionSafe1 endpoint using the parameterised query
The following query is performed which no longer allows for the sql injection demonstrated in the previous part
'select * from products where title = ${name};', { name: req.query.name, })

-Stored procedure
The /productsInjectionSafe2 api endpoint implements a second way of preventing the sql injection shown in the previous part

The following procedure was created, (Note: It was created through the shell)

 create or replace function select_products(Name VARCHAR(30) )
 returns setof products
 as
 $$
 select * from products where title = Name;
 $$
 language sql;

With these two methods the SQL injection shown in part 3 no longer works.



## part 4
Models have been created for all tables (products, purchases, purchase_items, users)
appropriate associations and referential integrity have been set up in the models.

All models can be found in the directory: worksheets/1-rest-sql-orm/part2/models/

## part 5
The models have been populated with dummy data
path: worksheets/1-rest-sql-orm/part2/populate.js
