Lab2 - EAD authentication with JWT and HMAC
The backend code exists within the folders lab2 and lab2part4
I used postman as a client for most of this lab, with the exception of lab2part4 where we were instructed to create a client in order to create a signature

all of my work can be viewed in a demo walk through here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18tDkwB3lsKz9FtZ7aYelBlcyOmx4seK3?usp=sharing
