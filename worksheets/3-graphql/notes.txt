Show tables in PSQL:
\dt default$default.

Prisma Migrations:
prisma deploy
prisma generate


So from what I can see, my datamodel is what specifies my tables in the database or whatever. My schema.graphql
then specifies the types and also my queries and migrations that can be used.


Other Stuff:
String => String type
String! => Required String
ID! => Auto generates global ID
